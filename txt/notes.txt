Next round. This time, using the clipping and scaling of PostScript.

The map I generate will be built of equilateral triangles of side length
1 unit. The full map, unwrapped, will be 5.5 units wide. PostScript will
do the scaling to the right paper size (tabloid).

The other change is that each face will be built using circles, drawn in
their entirety but clipped outside the triangle.
